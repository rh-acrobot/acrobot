Actions:
*Get an acronym explanation:* `@Acrobot acronym` 
*Insert an acronym:* `@Acrobot ${COMMAND_PREFIX}acronym${ACRONYM_EXPLANATION_SEPARATOR}explanation` 
*Change old explanation to a new one:* `@Acrobot ${COMMAND_PREFIX}acronym${ACRONYM_EXPLANATION_SEPARATOR}old explanation $EXPLANATION_REPLACEMENT_SEPARATOR new explanation` 
*Delete old explanation:* `@Acrobot ${COMMAND_PREFIX}acronym ${ACRONYM_EXPLANATION_SEPARATOR} old explanation ${EXPLANATION_REPLACEMENT_SEPARATOR}`
*List your explanations:* `@Acrobot ${COMMAND_PREFIX}my_explanations`
*Delete all of your explanations:* `@Acrobot ${COMMAND_PREFIX}my_explanations delete`
You can add an explanation to an already existing acronym the same way as inserting. 
All of the actions work in a direct message without tagging `@Acrobot`. Whitespace doesn't matter,and acronyms are matched without regard to case.
